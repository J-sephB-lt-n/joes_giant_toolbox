# Joe's Giant ToolBox

This is a large collection of general python functions and classes that I use in my daily work

The various functions/classes are in varying levels of completeness (e.g. some will have incomplete documentation or missing unit tests)

I have added in a confidence score for each function/class:

Confidence Score | Description                      
-----------------|-----------------------------------------
1                | Skeleton of function/class is present but the code does not work fully yet 
2                | The code appears to work perfectly, but has not been thoroughly tested
3                | Code appears to work perfectly and passes unit tests, but has not yet been used in a production environment or large real world project 
4                | Code has been used (without any failures) in a production environment (or large real world project)
5                | Code has been used multiple times (without any failures) in production environments (or large real world projects)

You can search by category:

* [API and Web](#api-and-web) 

* [Data Visualisation](#data-visualisation)

* [Google Cloud](#google-cloud)

* [Statistical Inference and Hypothesis Testing](#statistical-inference-and-hypothesis-testing)

..or you can just scroll through the master list:
