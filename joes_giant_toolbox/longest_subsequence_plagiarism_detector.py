    """
    Finds the longest [n_seq] consecutive sequences of words in [lookup_text] which also appear in [ref_text]

    This function was coded in a great rush and so:
    *   Is very slow
    *   Is very memory inefficient
    *   Is nonetheless useful, so I have kept it

    Parameters

    Returns
